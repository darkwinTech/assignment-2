# Aleen AlQarni – Personal Portfolio - Assignment 2

## 📌 Assignment Description
For Assignment 2, I focused on enhancing my portfolio website by adding dynamic and interactive 
features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For Dynamic Content, 
I implemented a personalized greeting that updates based on the time of day and the user’s stored 
name, added interactive buttons that allow users to switch between sections such as “Skills” and “Education,” 
and created a project list that can be filtered and sorted by criteria like date or title. In the Data Handling section, 
I integrated the Cat API to fetch and display random images, and developed a simple contact form that validates user inputs, 
shows confirmation messages, and stores submitted data in local storage for persistence. For Animations and Transitions, 
I added smooth fade-in effects to improve the user experience and make the website feel more engaging. Lastly, for Error Handling
and User Feedback, I implemented inline error messages for invalid or empty fields (such as the email input), displayed friendly
messages when API requests failed with an option to retry, and included loading states “Loading a cute cat” text while data is being fetched.
