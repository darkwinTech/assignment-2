# AI Usage Report

Document your AI tool usage here.
Tools used:

OpenAI’s ChatGPT (AI assistant).
Prompts or actions:

I asked the AI questions related to my assignment, such as fixing issues in my HTML/CSS code (e.g., why the hamburger menu didn’t appear, why it was misaligned, and how to structure the sidebar navigation).
Verification process:

I tested the AI’s suggestions by copying the generated code into my project, running it in the browser, and confirming whether the issues (sidebar visibility, menu alignment, background image path) were fixed. When necessary, I modified the AI’s suggestions to fit my specific project setup (e.g., relative paths for images)
Ethical considerations:

AI was used as a support tool to debug and learn best practices, not to fully replace my own work.
