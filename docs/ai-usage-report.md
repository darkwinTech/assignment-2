# AI Usage Report


**Tool Used:** OpenAI’s ChatGPT (AI Assistant)
---
## Project Overview
For this assignment, I enhanced my **personal portfolio website** by integrating:
- **Dynamic Content**
- **Data Handling**
- **Animations and Transitions**
---
##  AI Prompts & Actions
### 1. Dynamic Content
- **Original Implementation:** Displayed a greeting message based on the time of day.
- **AI Suggestion:** Add a stored username for a more personalized experience.  
    → Implemented the username display alongside the time-based greeting.

**Project Sorting Feature:**
- I was deciding between:
    - Dropdown sort
    - Button sort
- **AI Recommendation:** Use a **button sort**, as it demonstrates interactivity and a cleaner design approach.  
  → Implemented a single interactive button to dynamically sort projects by date.

**Learning Outcome:**  
- Gained hands-on experience with **event-driven programming** and **interactive UI design**.

### 2. Data Handling
- **Initial Attempt:** Tried using the **NASA API** to display random images.
- **Issue:** Faced authentication key errors and inconsistent data formatting.
- **AI Guidance:** Explained why the NASA API was unreliable for this use case and suggested using a simpler alternative.  
  → Switched to the **Cat API**, which provides consistent image data and simpler integration.

**Learning Outcome:**
- Learned how to **fetch and process data from public APIs**
- Debugged common API issues
- Understood how to evaluate APIs based on **complexity and reliability**

### 3. Animations & Transitions
- **AI Suggestions:**
    - Add **hover animations** for buttons
    - Include **fade-in effects** for content using CSS transitions  
      → Implemented both for smoother and more engaging user experience.

**Learning Outcome:**  
Improved understanding of **CSS transitions** and **UI/UX enhancement through motion design**.
